# Prosper Loan Data Exploration

## Dataset

The Prosper Loan dataset contains information about over 110,000 loan listings and 81 varaibles pointing to a number of factors relating to  the loan. Some popular variables include:
- Loan Status - Indicating the status of the loan. Whether it's cancelled, completed, defaulted or even past due date.
- Listing Category - The reason the borrower took the loan. Examples include Auto, Engagement rings, Wedding loans, and reasons as weird as Taxes.
- Occupation - This contains the occupation of the borrower.

Other interesting variables abound in the dataset, and for this project we would be exploring the different variables and how they relate to one another. We would also be plotting some visualizations using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate plots to explore many relationships in the data set. Some findings and key insights would also be derived for a slidedeck presentation.



## Summary of Findings


During my exploration, i quickly realized that the reason people took out loans were quite different than what i expected. Debt consolidation, Home Improvement and Business topped the reason while loand for boats and RVs were at the bottom. I also discovered that there was a strong correlation between the income of the borrower and the loan amount given. Another correlation exists between the loan amount and the monthly payment. 

Outside of the main features of interest it was also worthy to note that the fact that a borrower was a homeowner improved their chances of getting a higher loan. People in California tend to take more loans and Professionals and Computer Programmers took more loans than people from other occupations. 3 years was also the most popular loan term as opposed to 5 years and 1 year.

Retired and unemployed people rarely took loan, most likely owing to the fact that the chances of defaulting would be extremely high.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For my insight, I would be focusing entirely on the different reasons people take out loans and the variables that inflence their likelihood to get a loan and the loan amount available to different types of borrowers. I would start with the demography of the borrowers to get a general idea about who make up the population, their occupation and states. I would use a number of plots and chart to show this. I would then proceed to the main variable of interest, showing how different variables influence the loan amount. Finally, i would show how 4 different variables in the dataset relate to one another.
